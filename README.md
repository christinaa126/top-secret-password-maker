# top-secret-password-maker

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
By building this password generator I was able to learn how to utilize if statements, functions, and the while statement. 
I was also able to further my knowledge of the use of the window object in javascript

Given that I would like a new and very secure password (with the option of uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers )
