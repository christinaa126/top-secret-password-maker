# top-secret-password-maker

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
By building this password generator I was able to learn how to utilize if statements, functions, and the while statement. 
I was also able to further my knowledge of the use of the window object in javascript

Given that I would like a new and very secure password (with the option of uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers )

When the generate password button is clicked the user will be prompted to enter number of characters they wouldlike their password to be

If the number entered is less than 8 or greater than 128, an alert message will be displayed letting the user know

Next the user will be asked to confirm whether or not they want lowercase letters


Next the user will be asked to confirm whether or not they want uppercase letters

Next the user will be asked to confirm whether or not they want special characters

Next the user will be asked to confirm whether or not they want numbers

IF the user chooses one of these options then it will be stored in a variable and generate a random password using a WHILE condition
